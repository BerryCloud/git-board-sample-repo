# Migrate to latest version of OpenJDK

Currently latest version is Java 11 and the API's use Java 8.

We need to do this task because the Oracle licensing for Java has changed. The new Oracle license effectively forces us to use the latest version of Java at all times.

We need the following to support Java 11:

- All Maven dependancies
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Our code base
- Maven Docker container

When this task is completed the title should be updated to reflect the exact version that we migrated too.
