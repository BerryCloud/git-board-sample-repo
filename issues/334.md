# Mobile search

Mobile search is displayed full screen.

- both vertical and landscape design
- both search input and search results
- replace search input by button on the mobile home page
- reposition elements on home page
- define and introduce grid system
  - use CSS grid, it has [good enough support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid) and [gap properties can be used with create-react-app](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features#gap-properties)
  - based on baseline and vertical rhythm as [they do it in Atlassian](https://atlassian.design/guidelines/product/foundations/grid)
  - other inspiration: [Material Design](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#grid-behavior), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)
