# Bare HTTPS URL not working

Following URL does not work: https://windfreaks.net

- [x] identify the problem and fix
- [x] research DNS providers
- [ ] decide if it is worth fixing now
- [ ] select DNS provider
- [ ] use DNSimple
- [ ] set up ALIAS record for naked domain

## Notes

Hover uses subdomain redirect when forwarding naked domain to www subdomain. Unfortunately, [SSL does not work](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/apex-domains#ssl) when using the subdomain redirect.

The only way to make this work without paying for fixed Heroku IP is to pay for [a DNS provider](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains#configuring-dns-for-root-domains) that implements CNAME-like functionality on the naked domain.

Using a DNS provider would allow me to use the naked domain as the primary domain which is what I prefer.

## DNS Providers Pricing
Provider   | Price 1 | Price 2
----------|--------|----------
[DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/pricing) | $5/mo unlimited queries
[DNS Made Easy](https://dnsmadeeasy.com/pricing/) | $2.5/mo 5M queries
[Easy DNS](https://easydns.com/dns/) | $2/mo 1M queries | $3.5/mo 5M queries
[PointDNS Heroku Addon](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/pointdns) | for free 10k queries | $15/mo 1M queries

I expect no more than 1M queries now with TTL set to 1 hour for A records and 24 hours for CNAME records.

More details are recorded in Lessons Learned Gitbook.

## Resolution

**Not right now.** Just set the preferred domain for Google to www.

Later use DNSimple because of unlimited queries and friendly nice website indicating usability focus.
