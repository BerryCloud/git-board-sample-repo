# Module cannot be deleted

Some modules cannot be deleted.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Navigate to Modules.
2. Delete *Beating the Blues* or *Mealtime Choices*.

**Current behavior:** Module is not deleted. Generic error message "Failed to delete module" is shown.

**Expected behavior:** Module is deleted or a message suggesting a solution is shown.

Some modules can be deleted. It seems reports or some other object is blocking it. API returns *400 ConstraintViolation exception*. If this is the case, we need to identify this type of error and show relevant message.
