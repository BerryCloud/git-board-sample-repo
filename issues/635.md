# Pages remain scrolled to the position of previous page

This issue only becomes apparent when revisiting a previously loaded page (on first entry the page content is not there, therefore there is no scroll bar and nowhere to scroll to).

To reproduce:

1. Go to group list page.
2. Go to user list page.
3. Scroll to the bottom of user list page.
4. Go to group list page.
