# Date range picker

**Administrator** selects date range for the reports to see data for a certain period and compare different periods.

- applies to both reports and data
- similar functionality as Toggl date range picker
- rule to apply: when showing module metrics (completion, scores, etc.), include data only for users that started (or have been assigned) module within specified period
  - reports would be useless in case of including users that started previously and had some events or even completed during specified period
- questions:
  - How do metrics look like in a certain period?
  - What is the difference in a certain metric between two different periods?
